							A few years ago, I found that creating something from scratch is an incredibly rewarding experience. Since That time, I've used my breaks from school to work on various projects. I't started with building an end table for my dorm, and has grown intro several other projects. Below, I listed some if my more notable experiments, and I look forward to creating and documenting more in the future.

						<div class="section_header">Family Crest</div>
						<div class="h_title_border section_break"></div>

						<p>
							This project is made from Oak, without any power tools. It is my interpretation on the Hoftrichter family crest. The majority of the carving was done using a penn knife and a coping saw. It was stained with a very dark, single coat, and finished with a light coat of spray on low gloss polyurithane.

						<div class="section_header">End Table</div>
						<div class="h_title_border section_break"></div>

						<p>
							This was a personal project, and my first exploration into making furniture. It was make from poplar, as an attempt to avoid a lesser wood like pine, while keeping price down. Unfortunately, I soon realized that poplar is notoriously difficult to stain. This resulted in a very light 'natural' stain with a painted on polyurithane finish.

						<div class="section_header">Slovenian Crest</div>
						<div class="h_title_border section_break"></div>

						<p>
							As a gift to my mother, I decided to carve the crest from the slovenian flag (our heritage). Like the family crest, this was done using oak, but the large grained wood proved to be a major challenge on such a small scale. Fortunately, I managed to keep mistakes to a minimum, and finished the same way as the family crest.

						<div class="section_header">Jewelry Box</div>
						<div class="h_title_border section_break"></div>

						<p>
							When my sister left for the peacecorps I decided that I should make her something to send to her. I had looked at making jewelry boxes and decided that it would be an excellent gift. The boxes was make from red oak, and the carvings were done by hand, the top being a compus, and under the lid are her initials. The stain I used was a very deep red, and it was finished with several coats of paint on polyurithane, and one coat of spray on polurithane to eliminate bubbles.
