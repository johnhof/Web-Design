<font size="05" color="ffffff">The Road not taken</font>
<br><br>
<font size="03" color="ffffff">
	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
	And sorry I could not travel both<br>
	And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
	And looked down one as far as I could<br>
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
	<br>
	Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
	And having perhaps the better claim<br>
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br>
	Though as for that the passing there<br>
	Had worn them really about the same,<br>
	<br>
	And both that morning equally lay<br>
	In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
	Oh, I marked the first for another day!<br>
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br>
	I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
	<br>
	I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
	Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
	Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br>
	I took the one less traveled by,<br>
	And that has made all the difference.<br>
