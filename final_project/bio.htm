						&nbsp;&nbsp;
						 My name is John M. Hofrichter, a senior at the University of Pittsburgh. I grew up in a town just south of the city, where I lived with my parents and two older sisters. The majority of my extended family is from the Pittsburgh area, with a few scattered across the globe. I attended Canon McMillan high school, and went on to Pitt, mostly because of my exposure from family alumni. 
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In late high school I found that I was fairly skilled working with computers, especially programming, leading to current Comp Sci track. I have taken many upper level courses (listed elsewhere on the site), and, despite my initial feelings, have found that programming is a very entertaining way to pass the time. In particular, I enjoy lower level system programming, with an emphasis on networks, and Cryptography. I spent three semesters working as a software developer for Ansys Inc. in my home town, and can truly see a rewarding future in the field.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In terms of free time, I usually occupy myself with several hobbies. A few years ago, I discovered the university climbing wall and fell in love. I went on to work at the wall as an instructor, and still do today. The majority of my climbing has been done in the tri-state area, the only real exception being several summits of Seneca Rocks, in central West Virginia. I plan on exploring more exotic locations once I have means to do so. My other main hobby is woodworking. I have created several objects from furniture to carved crests, and have found that creating an object on your own power is extremely rewarding.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The majority of my time is pent either working, exploring one of my hobbies, or hanging out with friends. This Summer I will be moving to the Baltimore suburbs for an internship, but will return to Pitt for another semester in the fall. After that time, I look forward to whatever the future holds!
